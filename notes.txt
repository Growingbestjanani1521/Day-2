HTML Browser view - Debugger, Inspect,
Browser js vs Node js
Data types
Copy by value and Copy by reference
Window & document object

// general note: index.html file kulla script.js file merge pana  <script src="./script.js"></script>
front  end means we can see the output directly by us, back end means we cant see the ouput directly by us

// HTML Browser view - Debugger, Inspect,

// browser view : create file index.html and press shift ! and cteate script file and merge the file <script src="./script.js"></script>
and open the index file and right click open with window to see the output for index file

// script: type some program and see the output in console display output
// debugger: elements we can change or edit code debugger
// browser.js vs node.js
// inspect : another name called developer tool

browser js: we can see the ouput in inspect,console
node.js : we can see the output in the terminal = node script.js

// Data types:
primitive : numbers,string,boolean
objects: array,objects

// copy by value: primitive datatypes:

var a = 2;
var b = 2; it assume the value and give the output "2" is the value
console.log(a==b);
* it gives value base output

// copy by reference : object datatypes:

var c = [1,2];
var d = [1,2];    we didnt assume the address in this index so we get false output
console.log(a==b);

var c = [1,2];
var d = c;(address)    we  assume the address in this index so we get true output
console.log(a==b);

// Window & document object

// window : overall screen is called global object
// Document: screen white colour inside the global object is called document

var/let/Const( 3 types of datatypes)

//var can be redeclared and reassigned
var a = 10;
a=20; //reassign
var a =30; //redeclare
console.log(a);

//let cannot be redeclared only it can be reassigned
let c = 10;
c=20; //reassign
console.log(c);

//const cannot be redeclared and reassigned
const b=5;
console.log(b);
